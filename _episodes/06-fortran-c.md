## Example

In this example we imagine we are on a desert island and wish to compute pi by
throwing darts:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/darts.svg)

Discuss briefly how you can approximate pi from such an experiment and how you would program it.

In this workshop we will implement this example in 3 different languages (C++,
Fortran, Python) and demonstrate how to call this functionality across
languages.

Later we will combine these 3 implementations in an example Python package.
